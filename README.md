Heyy.. I am going to dive in the world of Solana..


<-------Notes----->
SOL is Solana's 'native token' - this means SOL is used to pay transaction fees, rent for accounts, and other common. SOL is sometimes shown with the â—Ž symbol. Each SOL is made from 1 billion Lamports.
Addresses are often shown as base-58 encoded strings like dDCQNnDmNbFVi8cQhKAgXhyhXeJ625tvwsunRyRc7c8
Every interaction with the Solana network using @solana/web3.js is going to happen through a Connection object. The Connection object establishes a connection with a specific Solana network, called a 'cluster'. For now, we'll use the Devnet cluster rather than Mainnet. Devnet is designed for developer use and testing, and DevNet tokens don't have real value.
1 Sol = 1000000000 lamports  (1 billion lamports)
balanceInSol = balanceInLamports / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
